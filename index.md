# [Presentation Slides][slides]

# Developer Tools
You should use either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox to develop JavaScript programs in a web browser. Both browsers offer excellent developer tools:

* [Google Chrome][chrome-dev]
* [Mozilla Firefox][firefox-dev]

In particular, they offer consoles where you can type in and run JavaScript programs, as well as write JavaScript code to modify web pages you visit.

# [Project: Electronic Life][electronic-life]
This is a project in Marijn Haverbeke's [Eloquent JavaScript][eloquent-javascript]. It's a terrific (free) book on programming and JavaScript. The slides more or less cover up to Chapter 6.

# Next Steps
We've completely ignored interacting with the web, which is what JavaScript tends to be used most for. Now that you (hopefully) have a basic understanding of how the language works, you probably should learn [HTML and CSS][shayhowe] next. Then, you can learn about the [Document Object Model (DOM)][dom], which is how you interact with HTML and CSS in JavaScript. Once you can put all of those things together, you'll be able to build interactive web pages.

# Resources
* The [Mozilla Developer Network site (MDN)][mdn] is great reference on all things JavaScript. It includes tutorials, library documentation, and detailed explanations of language features. It also covers HTML, CSS, and web browser APIs.
* [Node.js][nodejs] is a platform that lets you run JavaScript programs outside the browser, just like you can for Python, Ruby, and other programming languages.
* [Mixu's Node book][mixu-node] is a free book on developing JavaScript programs for Node.js. If you want to use JavaScript as a general purpose programming language, this is a great place to start.
